0. What is REACT?
    it's a powerful package maintained by Facebook

1. Install the REACT package & create a REACT app (as of 2021.5)

    $ cd DirectoryChosen
    $ npx create-react-app ProjectFolderName

        -> it installs the react package and creates an app at the same time
        -> documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

2. Check the app

    (0) $ cd ProjectFolderName
    (1) open the "package.json" file
    (2) find "scripts" -> and we see "start"
    (3) terminal: $ npm start -> then it runs the app in my browser

3. Update the version of the libraries in your react app
    
    I. Mannually update to the latest version

    (1) check the latest version (by creating a new app): 
        (a) terminal: $create-react-app ProjectFolderName
        (b) open the package.json file in the newly created folder
        (c) check "dependencies"/"react-scripts", and memorize the version number (may also update the version of "react")
    
    (2) update the dependencies in the "package.json" file
        (a) return to your original project folder, open up "package.json"
        (b) update the 'dependencies'/'react-scripts' version number with the new one (1)(c)
    
    (3) re-install the updated version of package in terminal
        (a) $ cd "project folder"
        (b) $ npm install (then it's gonna read the package.json file, and reinstall everything using "react-scripts" with the new version)
    
    (4) check if it still works with terminal

        ($ cd the project folder) 
        $ npm start

    II. Auto update with npm commands

    (0) $npm start
    (1) $npm audit fix -> auto fix for you (but might not fix them completely)
    (2) $npm audit -> check your dependencies and show how many vulnerabilities there are
    (3) $npm update -> update the newer compatible versions (but not necessarily latest)
    (4) $npm audit fix --force -> when you've checked all the vulnerabilities and assume everything would be fine, then use this
    
    (5) $npm audit to check vulnerabilities again, $npm start to check if the app still works

4. Deployment
    (0) $npm run build -> React creates a build folder for easier deployment later
    (1)
