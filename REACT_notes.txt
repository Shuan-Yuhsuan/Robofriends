0. What is REACT?
    it's a powerful package maintained by Facebook

1. Install the REACT package & create a REACT app (as of 2021.5)

    $ cd DirectoryChosen
    $ npx create-react-app ProjectFolderName

        -> it installs the react package and creates an app at the same time
        -> documentation: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

2. Check the app

    (0) $ cd ProjectFolderName
    (1) open the "package.json" file
    (2) find "scripts" -> and we see "start"
    (3) terminal: $ npm start -> then it runs the app in my browser

3. Update the version of the libraries in your react app
    
    I. Mannually update to the latest version

    (1) check the latest version (by creating a new app): 
        (a) terminal: $create-react-app ProjectFolderName
        (b) open the package.json file in the newly created folder
        (c) check "dependencies"/"react-scripts", and memorize the version number (may also update the version of "react")
    
    (2) update the dependencies in the "package.json" file
        (a) return to your original project folder, open up "package.json"
        (b) update the 'dependencies'/'react-scripts' version number with the new one (1)(c)
    
    (3) re-install the updated version of package in terminal
        (a) $ cd "project folder"
        (b) $ npm install (then it's gonna read the package.json file, and reinstall everything using "react-scripts" with the new version)
    
    (4) check if it still works with terminal

        ($ cd the project folder) 
        $ npm start

    II. Auto update with npm commands

    (0) $npm start
    (1) $npm audit fix -> auto fix for you (but might not fix them completely)
    (2) $npm audit -> check your dependencies and show how many vulnerabilities there are
    (3) $npm update -> update the newer compatible versions (but not necessarily latest)
    (4) $npm audit fix --force -> when you've checked all the vulnerabilities and assume everything would be fine, then use this
    
    (5) $npm audit to check vulnerabilities again, $npm start to check if the app still works

4. Deployment
    (0) Preprocess: React documentation https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages
        (a) in "package.json", add
            "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/githubRepoName",
            "predeploy": "npm run build",
            "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
        (b) $ npm install --save gh-pages

    (1) Push this depository to github
        (a) create a new depository in GitHub
        
        $ cd 'project folder'
        
        (b) $ git init
            (create a remote repository in this folder)
        (c) $ git remote add origin https://... 
            (copied from GitHub)
        (d) $ git status => $ git add . => $ git commit -m '...' 
            (to include all the changes if necessary)
        (e) $ git push -u origin main 
            (copied from GitHub)

    (2) Deploy the app to GitHub page
        (a) $ npm run deploy 
            (with step 0a, 'build' command will be run and create a 'build' folder)
        (b) Check it out on GitHub
            Repository => Settings => Pages => Source (select brance "gh-pages") => click the url "your site is published at https://..."
        (c) Create a shortcut
            back to the "<> Code" tab of the Repository => paste the url above to "about"
    (3) Update 
        (a) Push the changes to GitHub: repeat step 1d~1e
        (b) Deploy again: repeat step 2a
